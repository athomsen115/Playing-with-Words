# Palingrams

Palingrams are two-words that form a palindrome.
Examples are 'nurses run' or 'stir grits'.

If the word reads both forward and backward with two words, it is called a semordnilap.
Semordnilap is palindromes spelled backward. Examples are 'bats stab' or 'wolf flow'.

Three dictionaries are available: dictionary.txt, wordlist.txt, words.txt.
They are all different lengths and produce different results. Test this code with the different lists to see the differences.
